  <p id="AM1">Hi there!  My name is JeaShé Denise Sherpell a junior at Coram Deo Academy in the state of Texas.  I love being able to balance the complexities of science and technology with my fun and creative side. Having a purpose and timeless passion to create the uncreated, I found what I truly wanted to do in life, invent cures that will further advance the medical field.  
With the belief of helping others, I know that God has given me the purpose to create and innovate.  I’m joyously inspired by Solomon’s words, “How much better to get wisdom than gold, to get insight rather than silver (NIV, Proverbs 16:16)!  When I read and hear stories about this ugly disease called cancer, the determination to learn and share more about it is fueled even greater.
My mission in life is not merely to survive, but to thrive.  I want to go from success to significance and do my best to share my achievements with the world through passion, compassion, humor, and some style!
